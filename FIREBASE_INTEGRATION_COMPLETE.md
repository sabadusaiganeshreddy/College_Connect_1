## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Setup (Development)
- Database rules are in **"test mode"**
- Anyone can read/write (good for development)
- **Test mode expires in 30 days**

### Before Production
Update Firebase rules to:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "colleges": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": true
    }
  }
}
```

For even better security, add Firebase Authentication later.

## 📊 Code Changes Summary

### Added Imports
```typescript
import { database } from './firebase';
import { ref, set, onValue } from 'firebase/database';
```

### Real-Time Listener
```typescript
onValue(collegesRef, (snapshot) => {
  const data = snapshot.val();
  if (data) {
    setColleges(data); // Updates UI automatically!
  }
});
```

### Save to Firebase
```typescript
// Automatically saves whenever data changes
set(collegesRef, colleges);
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you see errors:

**"Permission denied"**
- Solution: Check Firebase Database Rules are in "test mode"

**"Firebase not initialized"**
- Solution: Update `src/firebase.ts` with your real config values

**Data not syncing**
- Solution: Check internet connection
- Verify Firebase config is correct
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Stuck on loading screen**
- Solution: Check Firebase config, especially `databaseURL`
- Make sure Realtime Database is enabled in Firebase Console
